# SnakeGameSDL2

To get the project working : 
1) Make sure you've downloaded SDL2/SDL2_image and added libraries and include directories to the project.
2) Make sure SDL2.dll, SDL2_image.dll, zlib.dll, libpng16-16.dll is in the source file.

# Technical Issues : 
1) Linked list is used to create the snake in that way all parts are following the former one like chain.

# If i have more time, I'll add : 
1) Add end menu, get the total score.
